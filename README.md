## Project Description

Solving the Rubik's Cube Blindfolded (BLD) can get difficult and I experienced that firsthand when I was learning how to solve it BLD as well. I've looked for applications or tools that could've helped with the learning process or accelerate learning efficiently, but just couldn't find anything that I was looking for. So I thought, why not build one? This application is an AI-assisted training tool designed to help people learn and master solving the Rubik's Cube BLD using the Old Pochmann Method. It combines computer vision, machine learning, and cubic algorithms into a single interactive system that teaches, guides, and assists the solver.

## Features

- Help capture a clean high quality dataset specific to your environment, lighting, and cube
- Train a KNN based on the dataset
- Predication and accuracy playground
- Save and map shown scramble to camera
- Display lettering of Pochmann letters for all faces correct for any/all orientation(s)
- Generate the solving order sequence strings for edges and letters
- Generate setup moves, algorithms, and placement moves
- Handle solving parity


## Installation Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repository-name.git

2. Create and activate a venv

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # On Windows:
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # On macOS/Linux:
   source venv/bin/activate

3. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

Each folder is numerically prefixed to guide the order of folder navigation. In each folder, you'll find the same for each file. Run the files in order, and play around with the application!
